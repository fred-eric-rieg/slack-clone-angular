    <h3>Purpose of this web app</h3>
    <p>Slacky is a messaging app and collaboration tool inspired by Slack, which is a popular app among developers. This app is only intended to showcase coding skills
      and for testing purposes.</p>

    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>Threads, channels and direct messages are the communication channels to interact with other users.
      Threads allow you to organize discussions around specific messages and topics.
      A channel lets you organize conversations into dedicated workspaces like a specific project.
      Direct messages are private spaces between two or more users.

    <h3>Why is Angular used?</h3>
    <p>Angular is a platform and framework for building complex business applications in HTML and TypeScript. It
      combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated
      best practices to solve development challenges. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>

    <h3>Angular architecture</h3>

    <p>The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation
    context for components. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is
    defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables
    bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.</p>

    <h3>Components, services and router</h3>

    <p>Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and
    modify according to your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.</p>

    <p>Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views.
    Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular,
    reusable, and efficient.</p>

    <p>Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and
    provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>

    <p>The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>
